Project Description: OpenCart Manual Testing

The project "OpenCart" involves comprehensive manual testing of the OpenCart e-commerce platform. OpenCart is a widely used open-source online store management system that is feature-rich and customizable. The objective of this project was to ensure the functionality, usability, and reliability of the OpenCart platform through rigorous manual testing methodologies.

Project Scope and Activities
Testing Environment: The testing was conducted using the live OpenCart website environment, encompassing various versions and modules to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

Test Documentation: Extensive documentation was a key aspect of this project:

Test Scenarios: Created and documented detailed test scenarios to cover various user interactions, system functionalities, and edge cases. In total, over 100 test scenarios were developed.
Test Cases: Developed 100+ test cases based on the identified scenarios, ensuring thorough coverage of all aspects of the platform's functionality.
Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM): Created an RTM to map test cases to specific requirements, ensuring alignment with business and user needs.
Bug Reports: Generated detailed bug reports using tools like Jira or Bugzilla, documenting issues encountered during testing along with steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.
Test Execution and Reporting:

Executed test cases systematically, capturing test execution results comprehensively.
Logged defects promptly, ensuring clarity and accuracy in reporting.
Collaborated with developers to verify fixes and validate system behavior post-resolution.
Challenges and Learnings:

Addressed platform-specific challenges such as compatibility across different browsers and devices.
Learned nuances of e-commerce functionalities including checkout processes, payment gateways, and order management.
Continuous Improvement:

Iteratively refined test cases and scenarios based on feedback and evolving project requirements.
Actively participated in team discussions and retrospectives to improve testing strategies and efficiency.
Conclusion
The "OpenCart" manual testing project involved meticulous planning, execution, and documentation of over 100 test cases across various versions and modules of the OpenCart platform. The project not only enhanced proficiency in manual testing methodologies but also provided insights into e-commerce application testing complexities. Through this project, I contributed to ensuring the quality and reliability of the OpenCart platform, enriching my skills in software testing and quality assurance.
